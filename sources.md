## The 10.2/4" displays are of the type: VS104T-003A

  There is also a version with touch-screen, but that is not relevant/needed.
  
## Arduino compatible mega-pro 2560:

  The form-factor of this board is 'better' suited to hiding behind panels, plus it has a micro-connector which is more usual nowadays.
  Because the mega-pro 2560 does not contain a USB-Serial chip, you will need a USB<>serial converter. I got this one:

## Wiring 'loom'
  To construct the wiring, I have opted to go for 34/40 IDC connectors with flat-cables and the tool to 'crimp' them onto the connector.
  The mega-pro 2560 has a 40-pin connector, a 32 pin connector and a 6-pin version. The 6-pin is too 'hemmed in' to be used by the IDC connector (it needs some space left/right of it)

  The 40 conductor wire can also be 'stripped down' to make a 34 conductor one, so save youself some hastle and just order the 40 strand one:
